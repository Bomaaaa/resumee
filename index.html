        <h3>Software Development</h3>
        <p>My interest in coding began from watching a video of a young boy create a game that ended up saving
        his family from a crisis. I fell in love with the fact that you could build anything you imagined and that
      could help solve people's problems. I started coding when I entered college till date. Being able to build software that
     would impact the life of any user is one of my strongest drives in this field.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I discovered I had a voice when I was 13 years. I grew up singing in the choir to date.
           Music has been one of my greatest passions ever since. </p>
